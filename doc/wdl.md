### 1.1 json

An input JSON file includes all genomic data files, parameters and metadata for running pipelines. Pipeline will use default values if they are not defined in  input JSON file.

| main.resolution       | Integer   | Default: 0.5. Cell clustering resolution. This parameter sets the number of cell populations for downstream clustering, increasing this value can get more clusters. |


### 1.2 run.sh

Prepare the main analysis script:

We provide a example [run.sh](../example/wdl/run.sh)

```shell
export PATH=/miniconda3/envs/DNBC4tools/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/miniconda3/envs/DNBC4tools/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
java -jar /pipeline/wdl/cromwell-35.jar run -i config.json /pipeline/wdl/DNBC4_scRNA.wdl
```

For multiple samples, use the samplelist sample list file, refer to *DNBC4tools multi*, modify the scripts directory, replace it with the real path, and use the following command:`wdl.json`

```shell
/miniconda3/envs/DNBC4tools/bin/python creat_wdl_json.py --infile samplelist --outdir outdir
```



## Run

```shell
sh run.sh
```

- After execution, the execution directory(`cromwell-executions`) of DNBelab C4 analysis will be generated in the current directory. This directory is the main process directory, and the main process directory contains the workflow id. Each run, a workflow id will be automatically generated. Each workflow id contains task running scripts and running logs corresponding to four functional modules. 
- `symbol` A flag file that records whether each functional step is completed. If the step completion flag file exists in the symbol directory during reanalysis, the analysis step is skipped.
  - `01.oligoparse_sigh.txt`, oligo library data quality control filtering.
  - `02.cDNAAnno_sigh.txt`, cDNA library data quality control filtering, alignment and annotation to generate the expression matrix of all beads.
  - `03.M280UMI_stat_sigh.txt`, cell calling to obtain the effective beads in the droplet, and merge the beads in the same droplet.
  - `04.count_matrix_sigh.txt`,generate cell expression matrix.
  - `04.saturation_sigh.txt`, saturation analysis.
  - `05.Cluster_sigh.txt`, dimensionality reduction cluster annotation of cells after filtering.
  - `05.QC_sigh.txt`,filter the cells.
  - `06.splice_matrix_sigh.txt`, expression matrix of exonic region, expression matrix of RNA velocity analysis.
  - `07.report_sigh.txt`, organize the analysis results and generate web reports.
